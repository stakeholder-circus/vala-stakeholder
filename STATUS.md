# vala-stakeholder Status

- Phase target: deterministic first tranche
- Phase state: implemented; native and Docker validation are mandatory CI gates
- Program state: published deterministic widening
- Publication state: public GitHub repository on main
- Current implementation: compiled Vala runtime using GLib strings, struct catalog data, and deterministic rendering

## Evidence

- python3 scripts/validate_scaffold.py
- make compiler-proof
- make analyze
- make test
- GitHub ci-native, docker-smoke, sast, actionlint, dependency-review, and security-analysis

## Open

- Full live-provider/runtime support is deferred to the second-pass provider rollout.
